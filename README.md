### Note
The automation portions of this repo are severly out-of-date. I've been cherry-picking
the config stuff that I want for a while now. Cherry-picking configs seems to work fine
but it would be nice to have some setup automation for when I move to different machines.

### Things to Automate
- Install tools I use everywhere
  - vim
    - Pathogen
    - fugitive.vim
    - surround.vim
    - The NERD Tree
    - Syntastic
    - vim-airline
    - ctrlp.vim
    - commentary.vim
    - badwolf theme
  - tmux + oh my tmux
  - zsh + oh my zsh
  - shell completions (git, etc)
- Stage configs where they should go. (originally what this repo did)

### Other must-haves but maybe not automated install
  - docker
  - kubectl
  - All Jetbrains things
  - vscode
  - Postman
  - Beyond Compare
  - Evernote
